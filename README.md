# Vehicle Sensor Data Simulator ðŸš—ðŸ“Š

This Python script simulates random **vehicle sensor data** (engine, speed, battery, etc.) and logs it into a CSV file.  
It can be used for testing, practice, or generating datasets for analysis and visualization.

---

## ðŸ”§ Features
- Generates **100 rows** of random vehicle data.
- Sensor parameters include:
  - Engine RPM
  - Vehicle Speed (km/h)
  - Coolant Temperature (Â°C)
  - Oil Pressure (bar)
  - Fuel Level (%)
  - Throttle Position (%)
  - Battery Voltage (V)
  - Current Draw (A) *(negative if charging)*
  - Torque (Nm)
  - Air-Fuel Ratio
- **Timestamps increase randomly (1â€“10 seconds)** for a more realistic simulation.
- Data is saved to `vehicle_sensor_data.csv`.
